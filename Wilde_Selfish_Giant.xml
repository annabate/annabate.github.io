        <head type="level2">The Selfish Giant</head>

        <p>Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the <persName corresp="#children"
            >children</persName> used to go and play in the <placeName>Giant's
            garden</placeName><ref xml:id="n_note1" n="1" target="#note1">1</ref>.</p>

        <p>It was a large lovely <term corresp="#garden">garden</term>, with soft green grass. Here
          and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach
          trees that in the springtime broke out into delicate <term corresp="#blossoms"
            >blossoms</term> of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat on
          the trees and sang so sweetly that the <persName corresp="#children">children</persName>
          used to stop their games to listen to them. <q who="#children">“How happy we are
            here!”</q> they cried to each other.</p>

        <p>One day the <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName> came back. He had been to visit
          his friend the <persName corresp="#ogre">Cornish ogre</persName>, and had stayed with him
          for seven years. When he arrived he saw the <persName corresp="#children"
            >children</persName> playing in the garden.</p>

        <p><q who="#giant">“What are you doing here?”</q> he cried in a very gruff voice, and the
            <persName corresp="#children">children</persName> ran away.</p>

        <p><q who="#giant">“My own garden is my own garden,”</q> said the <persName corresp="#giant"
            >Giant</persName>; <q who="#giant">“any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody
            to play in it but myself.”</q> So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a
          notice-board:</p>

        <p><q who="#giant">TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED</q></p>

        <p>He was a very selfish <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName>.</p>

        <p>The poor <persName corresp="#children">children</persName> had now nowhere to play. They
          tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they
          did not like it. They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and
          talk about the beautiful garden inside. <q who="#children">“How happy we were there,”</q>
          they said to each other.</p>

        <p>Then the <name corresp="#spring">Spring</name> came, and all over the country there were
          little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the <persName corresp="#giant"
            >Selfish Giant</persName> it was still <name corresp="#winter">Winter</name>. The birds
          did not care to sing in it as there were no <persName corresp="#children"
            >children</persName>, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put its
          head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the
            <persName corresp="#children">children</persName> that it slipped back into the ground
          again, and went off to sleep. The only people who were pleased were the <name
            corresp="snow">Snow</name> and the <name corresp="#frost">Frost</name>.</p>

        <p><q who="#snow #frost">“Spring has forgotten this garden,”</q> they cried, <q who="#snow #frost"
            >“so we will live here all the year round.”</q></p>

        <p>The <name corresp="#snow">Snow</name> covered up the grass with her great white cloak,
          and the <name corresp="#frost">Frost</name> painted all the trees silver. Then they
          invited the <name corresp="#north_wind">North Wind</name> to stay with them, and he came.
          He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots
          down.</p>

        <p><q who="#snow #frost">“This is a delightful spot,” he said, “we must ask the <name corresp="hail"
              >Hail</name> on a visit.”</q> So the <name corresp="#hail">Hail</name> came. Every day
          for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and
          then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. He was dressed in grey, and
          his breath was like ice.</p>

        <p><q who="#giant">“I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,”</q> said the
            <persName corresp="#giant">Selfish Giant</persName>, as he sat at the window and looked
          out at his cold white garden. <q who="#giant">“I hope there will be a change in the
            weather.”</q></p>

        <p>But the <name corresp="#spring">Spring</name> never came, nor the <name xml:id="summer"
            >Summer</name>. The <name corresp="#autumn">Autumn</name> gave golden fruit to every
          garden, but to the <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName>’s garden she gave none. <q
            who="#autumn">“He is too selfish,”</q> she said. So it was always <name corresp="winter"
            >Winter</name> there, and the <name>North Wind</name> and the <name corresp="#hail"
            >Hail</name>, and the <name>Frost</name>, and the <name>Snow</name> danced about through
          the trees.</p>

        <p>One morning the <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName> was lying awake in bed when he heard some
          lovely music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the <name>King’s
            musicians</name> passing by. It was really only a <name>little linnet</name> singing
          outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that
          it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world. Then the <name
            corresp="#hail">Hail</name> stopped dancing over his head, and the <name>North
            Wind</name> ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open
          casement. <q who="#giant">“I believe the Spring has come at last,”</q> said the <persName
            corresp="#giant">Giant</persName>; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.</p>

        <p>What did he see?</p>

        <p>He saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall the <name
            corresp="#children">children</name> had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches
          of the trees. In every tree that he could see there was a little child. And the trees were
          so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms,
          and were waving their arms gently above the children’s heads. The birds were flying about
          and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and
          laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still <name>Winter</name>. It
          was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a <name>little boy</name>.
          He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was
          wandering all round it, crying bitterly. The poor tree was still quite covered with frost
          and snow, and the <name>North Wind</name> was blowing and roaring above it. <q who="tree"
            >“Climb up! little boy,”</q> said the <name corresp="tree">Tree</name>, and it bent its
          branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.</p>

        <p>And the <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName>’s heart melted as he looked out.</p>

        <p><q who="#giant">“How selfish I have been!”</q> he said; <q who="#giant">“now I know why
            the Spring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree,
            and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children’s playground
            for ever and ever.”</q></p>

        <p>He was really very sorry for what he had done. So he crept downstairs and opened the
          front door quite softly, and went out into the garden. But when the children saw him they
          were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became <name>Winter</name>
          again. Only the <name>little boy</name> did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears
          that he did not see the <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName> coming. And the
            <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName> stole up behind him and took him gently in
          his hand, and put him up into the tree. And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the
          birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them
          round the Giant’s neck, and kissed him. And the other children, when they saw that the
          Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the
            <name>Spring</name>.</p>

        <p><q who="#giant">“It is your garden now, little children,”</q> said the <persName
            corresp="#giant">Giant</persName>, and he took a great axe and knocked down the
          wall.</p>

        <p>And when the people went to market at twelve o’clock they found the <persName
            corresp="#giant">Giant</persName> playing with the children in the most beautiful garden
          they had ever seen.</p>

        <p>All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the <persName corresp="#giant"
            >Giant</persName> to bid him good-bye.</p>

        <p><q who="#giant">“But where is your little companion?”</q> he said; <q who="#giant">“the
            boy I put into the tree.”</q></p>

        <p>The <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName> loved him the best because he had kissed
          him.</p>

        <p><q who="#children">“We don’t know,”</q> answered the children; <q who="#children">“he has
            gone away.”</q></p>

        <p><q who="#giant">“You must tell him to be sure and come here tomorrow,”</q> said the
            <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName>. But the <name corresp="#children"
            >children</name> said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him
          before; and the <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName> felt very sad.</p>

        <p>Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the <persName
            corresp="#giant">Giant</persName>. But the <name>little boy</name> whom the <persName
            corresp="#giant">Giant</persName> loved was never seen again. The <persName
            corresp="#giant">Giant</persName> was very kind to all the <name corresp="#giant"
            >children</name>, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him.</p>

        <p><q who="#giant">“How I would like to see him!”</q> he used to say.</p>

        <p>Years went over, and the <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName> grew very old and
          feeble. He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the
          children at their games, and admired his garden. <q who="#giant">“I have many beautiful
            flowers,”</q> he said; <q who="#giant">“but the children are the most beautiful flowers of
          all.”</q></p>


        <p>One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. He did not hate the
            <name>Winter</name> now, for he knew that it was merely the <name>Spring</name> asleep,
          and that the flowers were resting. </p>

        <p>Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder and looked and looked. It certainly was a
          marvellous sight. In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with
          lovely white blossoms. Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them,
          and underneath it stood the <name>little boy</name> he had loved. </p>

        <p>Downstairs ran the <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName> in great joy, and out into the garden. He
          hastened across the grass, and came near to the child. And when he came quite close his
          face grew red with anger, and he said, <q who="#giant">“Who hath dared to wound thee?”</q>
          For on the palms of the child’s hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two
          nails were on the little feet. </p>

        <p><q who="#giant">“Who hath dared to wound thee?”</q> cried the Giant; <q who="#giant"
            >“tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.”</q>
        </p>
        <p><q who="#little_boy">“Nay!”</q> answered the child; <q who="#little_boy">“but these are
            the wounds of Love.”</q>
        </p>
        <p><q who="#giant">“Who art thou?”</q> said the <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName>,
          and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the <name>little child</name>. </p>

        <p>And the <name>child</name> smiled on the <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName>, and said to him, <q
            who="#little_boy">“You let me play once in your garden, today you shall come with me to
            my garden, which is Paradise.”</q>
        </p>

        <p>And when the <name>children</name> ran in that afternoon, they found the
            <persName corresp="#giant">Giant</persName> lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.
